This project involves analyzing coffee sales data from an anonymized restaurant. The dataset includes information such as customer IDs, product IDs, and sales figures. Using Excel, the data is organized using Customer ID and Product ID as primary keys. Techniques such as VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH are employed to retrieve additional information from other sheets within the workbook. Pivot tables are utilized to summarize and analyze the data, with pivot charts integrated and enhanced using slicers for interactive filtering. This analysis aims to provide insights into customer preferences, popular products, and sales trends, ultimately informing business decisions and strategies for the restaurant.
